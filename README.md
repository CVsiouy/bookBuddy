## Challenges and Solutions
During the development of BookBuddy, I faced a few challenges:
1. **Handling Asynchronous API Calls**: Fetching data from the Google Books API required asynchronous calls, which led to some issues in displaying the results properly. I overcame this challenge by using JavaScript `async/await` to handle asynchronous API calls effectively.

2. **Responsive Design**: Creating a responsive layout that looks good on various devices and screen sizes was a challenge. I tackled this by using CSS media queries to adjust the styles based on the screen size.

## Roadmap
The future plans for BookBuddy include the following enhancements:
- Implementing user accounts to save favorite books and reading lists.
- Adding additional filters and sorting options for search results.
- Integrating user reviews and ratings from other platforms.
